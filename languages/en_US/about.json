  "pabout":"Heritance Kandalama is an architectural masterpiece by Geoffrey Bawa that built overlooking the eighth wonder of the world – the rock fortress of Sigiriya. The hotel sits at the heart of the cultural triangle of Sri Lanka close to five UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The unpaved road through the jungle gives no clue to what to expect – there are no views of the hotel on the horizon. Then suddenly as you drive up a ramp a cave-like entrance appears. And even as you step into another world of minimalist white pillars and cool curving corridors enormous boulders intrude and birdsong hangs in the air. Our stylish bedrooms and suites offer wonderful views over Kandalama lake. As well as the delicious buffets and theme nights in our main restaurant also we offer fine dining in our Fusion Dinning Room and some more exotic unusual options."
